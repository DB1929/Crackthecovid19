# Crackthecovid19
Project for Hackathon organised by IBM. We have collected covid-19 data. We have found out initial hotspots of the disease. We have used ARIMA, ETS and SIR models to predict the future values. Followed by this we have performed GWR on the existing data to delineate important factors that are affecting the spread of Covid-19
